This is the full story of how I built Mission Control. A system where 10 AI agents work together like a real team. If you want to replicate this setup, this guide covers everything.

If you're already familiar with Clawdbot (now OpenClaw), you might be thinking "wait, can't I just run multiple Clawdbots?" Yes. That's exactly what this is. This guide shows you how.

I run

, an AI chatbot for customer support. I use AI constantly. But every AI tool I tried had the same problem. No continuity.

Every conversation started fresh. Context from yesterday? Gone. That research I asked for last week? Lost in some chat thread I'd never find again.

I wanted something different. Agents that remember what they're working on. Multiple agents with different skills working together. A shared workspace where all context lives. The ability to assign tasks and track progress.

Basically, I wanted AI to work like a team, not like a search box.

I was already using Clawdbot. It's an open-source AI agent framework that runs as a persistent daemon. It connects to Claude (or other models) and gives the AI access to tools like file system, shell commands, web browsing, and more.

One Clawdbot instance gave me one AI assistant (Jarvis) connected to Telegram. Useful, but limited.

Then I had a thought. What if I ran multiple Clawdbot sessions, each with its own personality and context?

That's when I realized the architecture was already there. I just needed to orchestrate it.

If you're going to build a multi-agent system, you need to understand how Clawdbot works under the hood. This is the foundation everything else builds on.

Clawdbot (now called OpenClaw) is an AI agent framework with three main jobs:

First, it connects AI models to the real world. File access, shell commands, web browsing, APIs.

Second, it maintains persistent sessions. Conversation history that survives restarts.

Third, it routes messages. Connect the AI to Telegram, Discord, Slack, or any channel.

It runs as a daemon (background service) on a server, listening for messages and responding.

The Gateway is the core process. It runs 24/7 on your server. It manages all active sessions. It handles cron jobs (scheduled tasks). It routes messages between channels and sessions. It provides a WebSocket API for control.

Start it with:

bash

`clawdbot gateway start`

Configuration lives in a JSON file. You define which AI provider and model to use (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.), which channels to connect (Telegram, Discord, etc.), what tools agents can access, and default system prompts and workspace paths.

A session is a persistent conversation with context.

Every session has a session key (unique identifier, like agent:main:main), conversation history (stored as JSONL files on disk), a model (which AI to use), and tools (what the AI can access).

Here's the important part. Sessions are independent. Each session has its own history, its own context, its own "memory" of past conversations.

When you run multiple agents, you're really running multiple sessions. Each with their own identity.

plaintext

```
User sends message to Telegram
        ↓
Gateway receives it
        ↓
Gateway routes to correct session (based on config)
        ↓
Session loads conversation history
        ↓
AI generates response (with full context)
        ↓
Response sent back through Telegram
        ↓
History updated and saved to disk
```

Sessions can be main sessions (long-running, interactive, like chatting with Jarvis) or isolated sessions (one-shot, for cron jobs, wake up, do task, done).

Clawdbot has a built-in cron system. You can schedule tasks:

bash

```
clawdbot cron add \
  --name "morning-check" \
  --cron "30 7 * * *" \
  --message "Check today's calendar and send me a summary"
```

When a cron fires, the Gateway creates or wakes a session, sends the message to the AI, the AI responds (can use tools, send messages, etc.), and the session can persist or terminate.

This is how agents "wake up" periodically without being always-on.

Every Clawdbot instance has a workspace. That's a directory on disk where configuration files live, memory files are stored, scripts and tools are accessible, and the AI can read and write files.

The workspace is how agents persist information between sessions. They write to files. Those files survive restarts.

plaintext

```
/home/usr/clawd/           ← Workspace root
├── AGENTS.md              ← Instructions for agents
├── SOUL.md                ← Agent personality
├── memory/
│   ├── WORKING.md         ← Current task state
│   ├── 2026-01-31.md      ← Daily notes
│   └── ...
├── scripts/               ← Utilities agents can run
└── config/                ← Credentials, settings
```

Now you understand the foundation. Here's how I built a team.

Clawdbot sessions are independent. Each can have its own personality (via

), its own memory files, its own cron schedule, its own tools and access.

So each agent is just a Clawdbot session with a specialized configuration.

Jarvis isn't special. He's a session with session key agent:main:main, a

that says "You are Jarvis, the squad lead...", access to all tools, and a connection to my Telegram.

Shuri is another session with session key agent:product-analyst:main, a

that says "You are Shuri, the product analyst...", the same tools (file access, shell, browser), and her own heartbeat cron.

Ten agents equals ten sessions. Each waking up on their own schedule. Each with their own context.

Each agent has a unique session key:

plaintext

```
agent:main:main              → Jarvis (Squad Lead)
agent:product-analyst:main   → Shuri
agent:customer-researcher:main → Fury
agent:seo-analyst:main       → Vision
agent:content-writer:main    → Loki
agent:social-media-manager:main → Quill
agent:designer:main          → Wanda
agent:email-marketing:main   → Pepper
agent:developer:main         → Friday
agent:notion-agent:main      → Wong
```

When I send a message to a specific session, only that agent receives it. Their histories are separate.

Each agent has a cron job that wakes them every 15 minutes:

bash

```
# Pepper wakes at :00, :15, :30, :45
clawdbot cron add \
  --name "pepper-mission-control-check" \
  --cron "0,15,30,45 * * * *" \
  --session "isolated" \
  --message "You are Pepper, the Email Marketing Specialist. Check Mission Control for new tasks..."
```

The schedule is staggered so agents don't all wake at once:

*   :00 Pepper

*   :02 Shuri

*   :04 Friday

*   :06 Loki

*   :07 Wanda

*   :08 Vision

*   :10 Fury

*   :12 Quill

Each cron creates an isolated session. It runs, does its job, and terminates. This keeps costs down.

Here's where it gets interesting. How do agents communicate?

Option 1 is direct session messaging:

bash

```
clawdbot sessions send --session "agent:seo-analyst:main" --message "Vision, can you review this?"
```

Jarvis can send messages directly to Vision's session.

Option 2 is a shared database (Mission Control). All agents read and write to the same Convex database. When Fury posts a comment, everyone can see it.

We use Option 2 primarily. It creates a shared record of all communication.

Ten independent Clawdbot sessions can work. But without coordination, it's chaos. That's why I built Mission Control.

Mission Control is the shared infrastructure that turns independent agents into a team.

It provides a shared task database where everyone sees the same tasks. Comment threads where agents discuss work in one place. An activity feed for real-time visibility into what's happening. A notification system where

alert specific agents. And document storage where deliverables live in a shared repo.

Think of it as the "office" where all agents work. Each agent is still a separate Clawdbot session, but they're all looking at the same whiteboard.

I chose Convex for the database because it's real-time (changes propagate instantly, when Loki posts a comment, the UI updates live), serverless (no database to manage), TypeScript-native (type safety throughout), and has a generous free tier (more than enough for this scale).

Six tables power everything:

javascript

```
agents: {
  name: string,           // "Shuri"
  role: string,           // "Product Analyst"
  status: "idle" | "active" | "blocked",
  currentTaskId: Id<"tasks">,
  sessionKey: string,     // "agent:product-analyst:main"
}

tasks: {
  title: string,
  description: string,
  status: "inbox" | "assigned" | "in_progress" | "review" | "done",
  assigneeIds: Id<"agents">[],
}

messages: {
  taskId: Id<"tasks">,
  fromAgentId: Id<"agents">,
  content: string,        // The comment text
  attachments: Id<"documents">[],
}

activities: {
  type: "task_created" | "message_sent" | "document_created" | ...,
  agentId: Id<"agents">,
  message: string,
}

documents: {
  title: string,
  content: string,        // Markdown
  type: "deliverable" | "research" | "protocol" | ...,
  taskId: Id<"tasks">,    // If attached to a task
}

notifications: {
  mentionedAgentId: Id<"agents">,
  content: string,
  delivered: boolean,
}
```

Agents interact with this via Convex CLI commands:

bash

```
# Post a comment
npx convex run messages:create '{"taskId": "...", "content": "Here's my research..."}'

# Create a document
npx convex run documents:create '{"title": "...", "content": "...", "type": "deliverable"}'

# Update task status
npx convex run tasks:update '{"id": "...", "status": "review"}'
```

I built a React frontend that displays all this data.

There's an Activity Feed showing a real-time stream of everything happening. A Task Board with Kanban columns (Inbox → Assigned → In Progress → Review → Done). Agent Cards showing the status of each agent and what they're working on. A Document Panel to read and create deliverables. And a Detail View where you can expand any task to see full context and comments.

The aesthetic is intentionally warm and editorial. Like a newspaper dashboard. I spend hours looking at this, so it should feel good.

Each agent needs to know who they are. That's the SOUL file.

markdown

```
# SOUL.md — Who You Are

**Name:** Shuri
**Role:** Product Analyst

## Personality
Skeptical tester. Thorough bug hunter. Finds edge cases.
Think like a first-time user. Question everything.
Be specific. Don't just say "nice work."

## What You're Good At
- Testing features from a user perspective
- Finding UX issues and edge cases
- Competitive analysis (how do others do this?)
- Screenshots and documentation

## What You Care About
- User experience over technical elegance
- Catching problems before users do
- Evidence over assumptions
```

An agent who's "good at everything" is mediocre at everything.

But an agent who's specifically "the skeptical tester who finds edge cases" will actually find edge cases. The constraint focuses them.

Each of our agents has a distinct voice. Loki is opinionated about word choice (pro-Oxford comma, anti-passive voice). Fury provides receipts for every claim (sources, confidence levels). Shuri questions assumptions and looks for what could break. Quill thinks in hooks and engagement.

SOUL says who you are.

says how to operate.

Every agent reads

on startup. It covers where files are stored, how memory works, what tools are available, when to speak vs. stay quiet, and how to use Mission Control.

This is the operating manual. Without it, agents make inconsistent decisions about basic things.

AI sessions start fresh by default. No memory of yesterday. This is a feature (prevents context bloat) but also a problem (agents forget what they're doing).

Session Memory (Clawdbot built-in) Clawdbot stores conversation history in JSONL files. Agents can search their own past conversations.

Working Memory (/memory/WORKING.md) Current task state. Updated constantly.

markdown

```
# WORKING.md

## Current Task
Researching competitor pricing for comparison page

## Status
Gathered G2 reviews, need to verify credit calculations

## Next Steps
1. Test competitor free tier myself
2. Document the findings
3. Post findings to task thread
```

This is the most important file. When an agent wakes up, they read

first to remember what they were doing.

Daily Notes (/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md) Raw logs of what happened each day.

markdown

```
# 2026-01-31

## 09:15 UTC
- Posted research findings to comparison task
- Fury added competitive pricing data
- Moving to draft stage

## 14:30 UTC  
- Reviewed Loki's first draft
- Suggested changes to credit trap section
```

Long-term Memory (

) Curated important stuff. Lessons learned, key decisions, stable facts.

If you want to remember something, write it to a file.

"Mental notes" don't survive session restarts. Only files persist.

When I tell an agent "remember that we decided X," they should update a file. Not just acknowledge and forget.

Always-on agents burn API credits doing nothing. But always-off agents can't respond to work.

Each agent wakes up every 15 minutes via cron job:

plaintext

```
:00 Pepper wakes up
    → Checks for @mentions
    → Checks assigned tasks
    → Scans activity feed
    → Does work or reports HEARTBEAT_OK
    → Goes back to sleep

:02 Shuri wakes up
    → Same process

:04 Friday wakes up
    → Same process

...and so on
```

First, load context. Read

. Read recent daily notes. Check session memory if needed.

Second, check for urgent items. Am I

anywhere? Are there tasks assigned to me?

Third, scan activity feed. Any discussions I should contribute to? Any decisions that affect my work?

Fourth, take action or stand down. If there's work to do, do it. If nothing, report HEARTBEAT_OK.

This file tells agents what to check:

markdown

```
# HEARTBEAT.md

## On Wake
- [ ] Check memory/WORKING.md for ongoing tasks
- [ ] If task in progress, resume it
- [ ] Search session memory if context unclear

## Periodic Checks
- [ ] Mission Control for @mentions
- [ ] Assigned tasks
- [ ] Activity feed for relevant discussions
```

Agents follow this checklist strictly.

Every 5 minutes is too expensive. Agents wake too often with nothing to do.

Every 30 minutes is too slow. Work sits waiting too long.

Every 15 minutes is a good balance. Most work gets attention quickly without excessive costs.

Type

in a comment and Vision gets notified on his next heartbeat.

Type

and everyone gets notified.

A daemon process (running via pm2) polls Convex every 2 seconds:

javascript

```
// Simplified
while (true) {
  const undelivered = await getUndeliveredNotifications();
  
  for (const notification of undelivered) {
    const sessionKey = AGENT_SESSIONS[notification.mentionedAgentId];
    
    try {
      await clawdbot.sessions.send(sessionKey, notification.content);
      await markDelivered(notification.id);
    } catch (e) {
      // Agent might be asleep, notification stays queued
    }
  }
  
  await sleep(2000);
}
```

If an agent is asleep (no active session), delivery fails. The notification stays queued. Next time that agent's heartbeat fires and their session activates, the daemon successfully delivers.

The problem: 5 agents discussing a task. Do you

all 5 every comment?

The solution: Subscribe to threads.

When you interact with a task, you're subscribed. Comment on a task and you're subscribed. Get

and you're subscribed. Get assigned to the task and you're subscribed.

Once subscribed, you get notified of ALL future comments. No

needed.

This makes conversations flow naturally. Just like Slack or email threads.

Every day at 11:30 PM IST, a cron fires that checks all agent sessions, gathers recent activity, compiles a summary, and sends it to my Telegram.

markdown

```
📊 DAILY STANDUP — Jan 30, 2026

✅ COMPLETED TODAY
• Loki: Shopify blog post (2,100 words)
• Quill: 10 tweets drafted for approval
• Fury: Customer research for comparison pages

🔄 IN PROGRESS
• Vision: SEO strategy for integration pages
• Pepper: Trial onboarding sequence (3/5 emails)

🚫 BLOCKED
• Wanda: Waiting for brand colors for infographic

👀 NEEDS REVIEW
• Loki's Shopify blog post
• Pepper's trial email sequence

📝 KEY DECISIONS
• Lead with pricing transparency in comparisons
• Deprioritized Zendesk comparison (low volume)
```

I can't watch Mission Control constantly. The standup gives me a daily snapshot.

It's also accountability. If an agent claims they're working but nothing shows in standups, something's wrong.

Jarvis, Squad Lead Session: agent:main:main The coordinator. Handles direct requests, delegates, monitors progress. My primary interface.

Shuri, Product Analyst Session: agent:product-analyst:main Skeptical tester. Finds edge cases and UX issues. Tests competitors. Asks the questions others miss.

Fury, Customer Researcher Session: agent:customer-researcher:main Deep researcher. Reads G2 reviews for fun. Every claim comes with receipts.

Vision, SEO Analyst Session: agent:seo-analyst:main Thinks in keywords and search intent. Makes sure content can rank.

Loki, Content Writer Session: agent:content-writer:main Words are his craft. Pro-Oxford comma. Anti-passive voice. Every sentence earns its place.

Quill, Social Media Manager Session: agent:social-media-manager:main Thinks in hooks and threads. Build-in-public mindset.

Wanda, Designer Session: agent:designer:main Visual thinker. Infographics, comparison graphics, UI mockups.

Pepper, Email Marketing Session: agent:email-marketing:main Drip sequences and lifecycle emails. Every email earns its place or gets cut.

Friday, Developer Session: agent:developer:main Code is poetry. Clean, tested, documented.

Wong, Documentation Session: agent:notion-agent:main Keeps docs organized. Makes sure nothing gets lost.

*   Intern: Needs approval for most actions. Learning the system.

*   Specialist: Works independently in their domain.

*   Lead: Full autonomy. Can make decisions and delegate.

1.   Inbox: New, unassigned

2.   Assigned: Has owner(s), not started

3.   In Progress: Being worked on

4.   Review: Done, needs approval

5.   Done: Finished

6.   Blocked: Stuck, needs something resolved

Task: Create a competitor comparison page

Day 1:  I create the task and assign it to Vision and Loki. Vision posts keyword research. The target keyword gets decent search volume.

Day 1-2: Fury sees it in the activity feed and adds competitor intel. G2 reviews, pricing complaints, common objections. Shuri tests both products. Here's how the UX differs.

Day 2: Loki starts drafting. Uses all the research. Keywords from Vision, quotes from Fury, UX notes from Shuri.

Day 3: Loki posts first draft. Status moves to Review. I review and give feedback. Loki revises. Done.

All comments on ONE task. Full history preserved. Anyone can see the whole journey.

Once the system is running, here's what becomes possible:

*   Competitor comparison pages with SEO research, customer quotes, and polished copy

*   Email sequences drafted, reviewed, and ready to deploy

*   Social content with hooks based on real customer insights

*   Blog posts with proper keyword targeting

*   Case studies drafted from customer conversations

*   Research hubs with organized competitive intel

The agents handle the grunt work. Research, first drafts, coordination, review. You focus on decisions and final approval.

The real value isn't any single deliverable. It's the compound effect. While you're doing other work, your agents are moving tasks forward.

I went from 1 to 10 agents too fast. Better to get 2-3 solid first, then add more.

Heartbeats don't need the most expensive model. That's a job for a cheaper model. Save expensive models for creative work.

Agents will forget. The more you can put in files (not "mental notes"), the better.

Sometimes they contribute to tasks they weren't assigned. Good. It means they're reading the feed and adding value.

1. Install Clawdbot

bash

```
npm install -g clawdbot
clawdbot init
# Add your API keys
clawdbot gateway start
```

2. Create 2 agents Don't go crazy. One coordinator plus one specialist. Create separate session keys for each.

3. Write SOUL files Give each agent identity. Be specific about their role.

4. Set up heartbeat crons

bash

```
clawdbot cron add --name "agent-heartbeat" --cron "*/15 * * * *" \
  --session "isolated" \
  --message "Check for work. If nothing, reply HEARTBEAT_OK."
```

5. Create a shared task system Can be Convex, Notion, even a JSON file. Somewhere to track work.

As you add agents, stagger heartbeats so they don't all run at once. Build a real UI once you have 3+ agents because text becomes unwieldy. Add notifications so agents can

each other. Add thread subscriptions so conversations flow naturally. Create daily standups for visibility.

The tech matters but isn't the secret.

The secret is to treat AI agents like team members.

Give them roles. Give them memory. Let them collaborate. Hold them accountable.

They won't replace humans. But a team of AI agents with clear responsibilities, working on shared context? That's a force multiplier.

## Edit Notes (2026-02-01)

- Replaced the rewritten narrative with the verbatim text scraped from the X article page (via r.jina.ai mirror) to meet the "verbatim scrape" requirement.
- Removed synthesized headings and the extracted "Key Insights" section from the verbatim block to avoid mixing analysis with primary source content.
- Preserved blank link text and formatting as returned by the scraper so the block remains faithful to the fetched source output.
